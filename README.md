# Nicola Soroka LSW Programming Interview
 clothes shop game


First few hours i spend to chose art from Unity asset store.
I imopt only art, not take any premade mechanics.
Paint simply building, add shopkeeper and few environment elements.

Add interaction with seller.
With Cinemashine implement zoom on player while interacting with seller.
Seller can say that player is too far away.
If player is close enough, open shop UI.
Some time was taken by thinking on shop organisation conception.
Items to sell must be placed as child of "Store" game object in project hierarchy.

Buy buttons generation is ready. When shop opens, a new button generates for each child object of Store with image, name and price of this object.
